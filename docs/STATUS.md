# STATUS — current work, blockers and next action

Updated 2026-10-10. Repository created by Chris; plan written by Claude (Opus 5.5) in the Appliance Desk planning system.
**A-1 through A-3 implemented (#9–#12), A-4a client (#13):** tested foundation, schema, durable OAuth, and isolated Stripe SDK client. No Stripe account has been connected; none of this is deployed or live.

## Next

- **Next A-5b:** secure owner setup page, real test-key verification and key-permission probes; A-5a encrypted credential storage and one-time secret primitives merged (#15). Real setup remains gated by IN-02/03/04.
- **Answered 2026-10-10:** IN-00 plan approved; IN-01 repository stays public, no automated (Codex) review — the
  implementer self-reviews every diff (AGENTS "Review").
- **Queue:** A → B → C → D → V → G → H → P → W → U → R → E → X (`MASTER-ROADMAP.md`).

## Environment

- Repo: `Robinson-AI-Systems/stripe-mcp`, default branch `main`. CI validates docs, secrets, tests with throwaway PostgreSQL and stripe-mock (PR #9). The first commit (this plan) went straight to `main`
  because the repository was empty; every later change goes through an `ai/*` branch and a PR.
- Vercel project, Neon database and Stripe test keys: not created yet (IN-02, IN-03, IN-04).

## Recent merges (newest first)

**2026-10-10 — A-5a encrypted credential primitives (PR #15):** AES-256-GCM encryption with no plaintext fallback, verified test-key persistence and atomically single-use secret records, with fake and real isolated Postgres tests. The authenticated setup page is still A-5b; nothing deployed.

**2026-10-10 — A-4b OpenAPI source (PR #14):** byte-exact Stripe v2556 SDK OpenAPI, pinned and verified against published Git blob SHA-1, bounded operation lookup and unit tests; stored as 23 immutable parts due provider API upload size. Next A-5.

**2026-10-10 — A-4a Stripe client (PR #13):** official SDK at API 2026-09-30.endive, stable scoped idempotency, bounded paging and preview live-key refusal. A-4b still owns vendored operation description.

**2026-10-10 — A-3b OAuth connector (PR #12):** personal persistent refresh, authorization page, MCP endpoint and metadata; full login behavior tested in unit and PostgreSQL. No live Stripe credentials configured.

**2026-10-10 — A-3b connector (PR #12):** auth page, OAuth registration/code/refresh, metadata, MCP bearer guard, personal persistent refresh authorization. No live keys, no money movement. Next A-4.

**2026-10-10 — A-3a primitives (PR #11):** core token-hashing, PKCE, IP/login lockout and hashed OAuth database methods, real-PG rotation tests. The connector endpoints are deliberately A-3b; do not claim A-3 complete.

**2026-10-10 — A-2 database schema (PR #10):** seven foundation tables and six indexes defined additively in code, tested only on throwaway PostgreSQL; no Neon database created and no Stripe records touched. Next A-3.

**2026-10-10 — A-1 foundation (PR #9):** Node ESM registry, test-only Stripe fake, disposable Postgres adapter, secret scan, docs and budget checks, four CI gates and single `ci` merger. No Stripe requests against real accounts.

**2026-10-10 — Review fixes (docs PR #8):** two gaps found by an automated review of the Workspace server's plan,
applied here: a login refresh keeps account, mode, profile and listing (A-3); the per-pass rate limit is stored per pass
and counted in a shared Postgres table with an atomic update, tested with overlapping requests across two instances
(R-2). Next action unchanged: A-1.

**2026-10-10 — For account owners too (docs PR):** G-6 owner and administration; every dashboard setting covered as a
real tool or a guided setting; audience tags.

**2026-10-10 — General development tool (docs PR):** Batch V developer tools added; test clocks moved from E; project
profiles made optional and general; Appliance Desk framed as an example and completeness check.

**2026-10-10 — Hub architecture (docs PR):** Batch R now provides only the Robinson Tool Contract doors (passes, HTTPS
API, manifest, conformance); CLI, relay and recipes moved to Robinson's Toolkit. Contract-generic code goes in `src/core/`.

**2026-10-10 — Owner answers recorded (docs PR):** IN-00 approved, IN-01 public / no automated review; designs
marked APPROVED; A-1 READY; review rule changed to self-review in AGENTS and PLAYBOOK.

**2026-10-10 — Plan written (initial commit):** AGENTS, START-HERE, SESSION-START, PLAYBOOK, drift protocol, PLAN,
MASTER-ROADMAP, 12 batch designs, TOOL-CATALOG (283 hand-built tools + 4 universal), Appliance Desk project profile,
owner inputs, go-live checklist, decisions, roadmap, work index with validator, first card A-1. The earlier plan version
is archived in `docs/archive/plan-v1/`.

## Blocked

Nothing in engineering. Owner inputs open: IN-02 … IN-12 (`OWNER-INPUTS.md`); none blocks A-1 … A-4.
